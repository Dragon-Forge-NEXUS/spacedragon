import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Below is file tree:

<FileTree>

- public
  - favicon.svg
- src
  - components
    - Card.astro
  - layouts
    - Layout.astro
  - pages
    - index.astro
  - env.d.ts
- .gitignore
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
- README.md
- tailwind.config.js only if the tailwind css option was picked
- tsconfig.json
</FileTree>

As of now that is the only file tree that can be generated, I hope to have <a href="https://starlight.astro.build">Astro Starlight</a> support soon!
