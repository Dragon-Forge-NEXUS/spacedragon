title: Install Astro with SpaceDragon
description: 'How to install Astro with NPM, PNPM, or Yarn via the SpaceDragon CLI tool.'

import PackageManagerTabs from '../../../components/tabs/PackageManagerTabs.astro'

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** - `v18.14.1` or higher.
- **Text editor** - We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Official Astro extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode).
- **Terminal** - SpaceDragon and Astro are accessed through their command-line interfaces (CLI).

#### Installation


:::caution[Known Error]
currently when using the CLI a error will popup, but it (as far as we know) doesn't effect the CLI's functionality
:::

## 1. Run the Setup Wizard

Run the following command in your terminal to start the SpaceDragon install wizard:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  # create a new project with npm
  npm create @dragonforgecode/spacedragon@latest
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  # create a new project with pnpm
  pnpm create @dragonforgecode/spacedragon@latest
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  # create a new project with yarn
  yarn create @dragonforgecode/spacedragon
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Just like the base `create-astro` you can run `create @dragonforgecode/spacedragon` anywhere on your machine, so there's no need to create a new empty directory for your project before you begin. If you don't have an empty directory yet for your new project, the wizard will help create one for you automatically.

If all goes well, you should see a "Next steps:" message followed by some recommended next steps. `cd` into your new project directory to begin using Astro.

If you skipped the `npm install` step during the CLI wizard, then be sure to install your dependencies before continuing.

From here, it is just like normal Astro development, so you should head over to [docs.astro.build](https://docs.astro.build/) and continue from there!
